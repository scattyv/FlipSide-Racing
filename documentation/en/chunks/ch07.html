    <p>The How Fast Are You OnLine Point Series is a worldwide point series
    that any group can participate in. To compete you need at least 3 people
    racing, 2 Wide L's of <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rcptracks.com" target="_top">RCP
    track</a> and a suitable lap counter. The results of your race will be
    combined and ranked with all the other participating clubs around the
    world.</p>

    <p>Each month you group must run a event which comprises of 2 races on
    a specific track design, one clockwise and one counter clockwise. Since
    everyone is running the same layout each month we can then combine the
    race results of each club together to rank everyone for each race and
    season. Each season consists of 5 events, each event consists of 2 races
    and there are 2 seasons a year. You must submit your groups previous race
    results by the first day of each month. At the end of a season your worst
    2 races are dropped from your results and you will get your final
    worldwide ranking for that season.</p>

    <p>Various prizes and awards are available for the top 3 racers, the
    top under 16 years old racers and clubs. The events are quick and easy to
    run but the competition for the top ranking is fierce.</p>

    <p>We hope you will participate with our clubs in this unique and fun
    point series.</p>
